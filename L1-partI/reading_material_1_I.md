## How to Try Skills?

If you don't have a Claude subscription, you can still try the skill in Claude.ai using the Free Plan (with Sonnet 4.5 or Haiku 4.5). As of January 26, Skills are available in Claude.ai for free users.

Since skills are an open standard, you can also try them with any other skills-compatible AI application. You can find a list of supporting platforms [here](https://agentskills.io/home#adoption).

## How to Expand the `analyzing-marketing-campaign` Skill?

You can add:
- A reference file for how to analyze and fix data quality issues
- A reference file for all the marketing metrics you might be interested in computing
- Additional analysis that can be done with the data
- Instructions for querying data from a database when a CSV is not provided

We invite you to also think about your own workflow:
- Are there any instructions that you repeatedly ask an agent to follow?
- Can you think of putting them together in a skill?
- Are there any specific guidelines that you want your agent to always follow for a specific task?

**Note:** All the skills shown in this course are for educational purposes. There is room to enhance and iterate on each skill shown.
